Serial Dependence CANN Model
============================

A JAX implementation of the two-layer continuous attractor neural network (CANN)
model with short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) for studying serial dependence
in visual perception.

Based on: "Neural Correlates of Serial Dependence: Synaptic Short-term Plasticity
Orchestrates Repulsion and Attraction" (NeurIPS 2025)
